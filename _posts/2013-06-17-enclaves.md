OK. Today I'm going to talk about [the project I've been working on at Hacker School](http://github.com/thewhitlockian/enclav.es). Now, I've had my run around the standard academic programs and I've written a fair number of throwaway toys, so I'm spending the first month at Hacker School writing up to a stable usable version of a fairly large project, from scratch. This project is a message board written in Python, based on the Tornado web server and the Titan graph database, with no web framework (for a number of reasons). I had been calling it Cluster, but I changed the name to enclav.es after having a brainstorm given by a fellow Hacker Schooler, and because the .es TLD allowed me to perform a _totally cool_ [domain hack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack).

First let's address design choices. I'm using a graph database because the data I'm storing is inherently a graph. The way I see it, only Bad Things can come from trying to represent data in a form besides its inherent structure. Further, I'm using Tornado to allow me to do long polling and/or WebSockets to provide updates without traditional polling that has the tradeoff of being either laggy or non-instant. This is a modern application.

These choices have left me choosing between heavily modifying a framework like Flask or just going on my own. I've written a few toys with Rails before so I understand the magic and the (to really borrow a Rails term) _scaffolding_ that a framework would offer me, and I'm choosing to forgo these for greater freedom of design and for a fuller learning experience. There will be many times when I'll grab a framework and throw something together, but at least once I want to do it from scratch. OK, maybe not totally scratch, since I'm not handling sockets and things myself, but all but scratch.

So, onto the application itself. What have I done so far? Well, I'm still waiting on AWS credits from Hacker School to deploy it, so I'm going to post some screenshots and discuss features and hopefully there'll be a production version online before too long.

First of all, clearly I'm no visual designer (this blog makes that pretty clear), so my design is pretty sparse. But when an unregistered user visits the page, this is what (s)he is greeted with:

![Landing Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06172013+-+11%3A57%3A25+PM.png)

Since the site is invite-only, the usual "Sign up!" call to action is notably missing. If you have an invitation you won't even see this page until after you make your account, so this is really a page just for existing users.

Once a user signs in, they're greeted by the rest of the interface:

![Main Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06172013+-+11%3A58%3A05+PM.png)

The full list of enclaves on the right is temporary, as hopefully one day there will be too many to list. I'd like to algorithmically generate recommendations for users and put those there, but that's down the road. In the meantime, we can see a list of posts from other users (only link posts work now, and no comment sections yet). They're sorted by date right now.

All of the links on the page work, although the user pages aren't meaningful yet. Likewise, posting to an enclave is still in development, so while you can see an enclave's page, there isn't much point yet.

The settings page can be used to create new identities, and these are fully functional.

![Settings Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06172013+-+11%3A58%3A51+PM.png)

The new post page works for link posts, and the identity dropdown works to allow users to choose an identity to post with. In this example the name of the enclave has automatically been loaded into the appropriate field. This happens when you click the "New Post" link from inside of an enclave or visit /~enclave/new_post. The user can change this, however, and although this data is loaded it doesn't actually post the new post to the enclave yet, it just posts to the main site.

![New Post Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06172013+-+11%3A59%3A45+PM.png)

The invite page is here. It implores you not to invite assholes:

![Invite Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06172013+-+11%3A58%3A25+PM.png)

Sending an invitation to someone sends them an email. I'll flesh out the message later, but for now it's just a link to the development location and a unique token.

![Invitation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06182013+-+12%3A00%3A20+AM.png)

Clicking the invitation brings you to the sign up page, (after verifying the token is valid of course).

![New User Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06182013+-+12%3A01%3A06+AM.png)

This will bring the new user to the main page so that they can log in with their new account, where they can now create their own posts:

![New Post on Main Page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thewhitlockian_images/Screenshot+-+06182013+-+12%3A01%3A59+AM.png)

There are many, many features to come, but the base of the project is now in place. I spent the last couple of days switching from neo4j to Titan because of issues I have with their licensing scheme and a personal concern over Neo Technology's enthusiasm over Cypher, a technology for which I do not share their excitement.

Anyway, as I continue development on enclav.es I'll post more updates, and hopefully they'll be less lengthy now that my blog is caught up with the software!
