And I don't regret it, but here's why.
As the title states, I bought a Pebble about three weeks ago, totally oblivious to the coming Android Wear devices and the Apple Watch launch. I'm happy that I did, and it's because I honestly think this technological development, the advent of smart watches in general, is as foreseeable and obvious as it is mostly pointless, and the other devices require extra effort from the user over a normal watch without offering any substantial new utility.

This is what my regular watch does:
- Provides the time, date, stopwatch
- Is always on my arm
- Battery never dies, band will break first
- Was $11

This is what the best smartwatch ever would do:
- Texts/Notifications at a glance
- All the things my dumb watch does
- Various utility things (open the garage, be the remote, find my phone)
...


and that's it. The Pebble gets closer to the Ideal Smartwatch because although it's a much lower-power platform and therefore can't display, for instance, video or full color navigation, the battery technology today isn't present for those features to have a watch-like battery life. Four or eight hours for something that I mostly just read texts on? I have very little desire to try responding to texts on any kind of smartwatch device. Your phone has to be nearby to even receive them, so it's always easier to just respond on my phone.

The Android and iOS devices simply require too much upkeep for the utility they offer. They won't last a full day out (want to know if you're going to catch the train and your phone's dead? Oh shit your watch is dead too!) and they're not dirt/water resistant, which means you have Yet Another Expensive Piece of Tech to babysit whenever you go somewhere. On top of this the screen is more difficult to see in bright light, and all of this together makes it worse as a watch than my $11 Casio.

So how did the Pebble convince me? It's a tough, solid piece of tech, and while the software and ecosystem are immature, the almost-no-OS microcontroller makes more sense as a smartwatch in 2014. The low-power processor and e-ink screen make the battery last a week and it charges in about an hour, which means even for a perpetual watch-wearer like me, I can plug it in before bed on the weekend so I won't care when I can't figure out the time in the morning.

For the astute: I'm quite blind without my glasses, and don't like to find my glasses just to find out I can sleep for four more hours.

And so since it's a decent watch in its own right, I feel justified buying it, before we even get to the other features. There are many watches that cost far more than $150. It's a decent watch, I like the style, cool. The rest is extra. With the other smart watch devices, the rest is at the cost of a decent watch. You can have full color GPS directions on your wrist, but you can't have a decent watch. You could wear two watches, I guess. But who wants to be that guy?

So then there's the rest: the Pebble swaps songs when I'm driving (one button for Next is all I need, no eyes required), the [Pebble controls the Roku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tllwOBfGrTw), and I receive texts to my wrists.

Since my phone is nearby, most of this is arguably pointless, as it's all duplicate functionality. Why do I really need a separate device to do these things, especially if I already have a decent watch? But I find that I quite enjoy having the Pebble, and not just because it finally ended the terrible era of trying to figure out where the hell the remote went, but because it also ended the shorter era of where the hell did my phone go?

And really that's its best feature. I press a button, my phone beeps. I figure out where my phone is. And it's terrible that that's its best feature, because I know it's because I'm addicted to my phone. As soon as I got a smart phone I knew I was hooked, and every smartphone owner knows that weird, vague, anxious feeling when you're not really sure where your phone is. And slowly, as you fail to locate the damn thing, it grows into a panic, even when it's just been under the fucking bed the whole time.

Because the Pebble has a watch-like battery life, it's **always on my wrist** just like it should be, and so it allows me to alleviate my Anxiety from Smartphone Separation. As an extension of this, with my watch snugly attached to my arm, I always feel my notifications, so I no longer have the urge to pull my phone out of my pocket to check for missed messages. This actually keeps me off of my phone, which is good, I'd rather not be a zombie constantly messing with my phone.

So the lesson, the takeaway, the tl;dr here, is that good smart watches are the penultimate first world solution to the penultimate first world problem, Anxiety from Smartphone Separation, and if instead they become a device that, like a phone, needs to be constantly guarded from theft, damage, and needs frequent recharges, they will not alleviate the Anxiety from Smartphone Separation and are therefore without real utility and can function only as gadgets and jewelry.
