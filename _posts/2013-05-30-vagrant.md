title: Cluster and Vagrant

Tonight I finished work on a portable development environment for my pet project, [cluster.im](https://github.com/thewhitlockian/cluster.im), that I wanted to get finished before I got to [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com) on Sunday, in case anyone else wants to help with the project.

[Vagrant](vagrantup.com) provides me with a headless VM that builds automatically, and by running a couple of scripts included in cluster's git repository, one can easily run a local copy of cluster without updating one's system to match the software stack that cluster needs (Python 2.7.x, Java 1.6, redis, neo4j, and a number of Python dependencies that can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/thewhitlockian/cluster.im/blob/master/requirements.txt)).

In any case, I'm excited to get back down to business on the project now that Hacker School is mere days away.
