On the first day, Dave told us that "Hacker School is unlike the rest of the world." And boy howdy, was he right.

###What Hacker School Isn't
####Hacker School is not University

First, it's important to note that I don't think Hacker School is in competition with traditional education. Traditional education prescribes what its students should learn through a curriculum, attempts to measure this knowledge through exams and projects, and then offers something to prove to outsiders that you've jumped through those arbitrary hoops, in the form of a degree. At Hacker School, if you want to have something to show outsiders what you did, that's up to you. So is choosing what you want to study. And since Hacker Schoolers "never graduate," there is no certificate and no degree. Hacker School aims **only** to make you a better programmer. That's all.

So traditional education still has its place. Hacker School can't replace the five semesters of math that your CS program requires, for instance. If you're of the belief that an educated person should be "well-rounded", well, Hacker School isn't going to have you reading Kant or spending two semesters in a chemistry or physics lab either.

But Hacker School, since it is not measuring or ranking its students and has no tests, homework, or exams, is by nature a cooperative environment. **In five semesters of CS at Purdue, I don't believe a soul ever looked at a single line of my code** after my introductory Java course (where comments were required). Collaboration was strictly prohibited, and code was graded with a grading script that made sure it worked and wasn't too statistically similar to anyone else's code. The only exception to this was a single group project at the end of Systems Programming.

My algorithms professor explicitly told us not to look at solutions online to the data structures and algorithms we were implementing, lest they taint our understanding and cause us to set off the plagiarism script. To someone working in the industry, this is an absurd requirement that will only encourage new programmers to produce na√Øve implementations and never grow. This, in my opinion, is like asking budding architects to not study the works of the greats who preceded them. But the nature of assignments, homework, and individual study preclude that kind of learning.

Hacker School also doesn't cost [upwards of $30,000 a year](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76). Nick, Dave, and Sonali only get paid if you get a job with one of the partners, and it's not paid by you. Plus, Universities commit you to payment within a week of classes starting, often with no chance of a refund if the professor doesn't do his or her job. 

####Hacker School is not a Bootcamp

Hacker School is also not in competition with any of the numerous other "coding bootcamps." Hacker School is not a bootcamp. While in New York there were multiple occurrences where I introduced myself as knowing \[host of event\] through Hacker School and someone said "Oh, that's like the Flatiron School, yeah?" Well, no not really. The only things that Hacker School has in common with any of the [numerous programs](https://www.google.com/search?q=coding+bootcamp) proclaiming to turn you into a coder in twelve weeks is the length of time and the focus on technology. 

For one, bootcamps promise to make you marketable in some skill, usually specifically web development, and often on a specific technology stack (usually Rails). Hacker School is technology-agnostic, and although there does tend to be a focus on the web due to its overally popularity in the field, if you had an interest in anything from writing Android apps in Scala to proofs with Coq to hacking on `ghc`, the most widely-used Haskell compiler, to writing your own language, to writing a Lisp in 6502 assembly language, there was someone to work with.

[Secondly, Hacker School isn't for absolute beginners.](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/20-what-we-look-for-in-students) The minimum seems to be about three months of experience, but there also isn't a maximum. This is wonderful, because it means no matter where you are in your journey, you have someone to work with and help you. But you should at least be able to write [FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) before you arrive.

Hacker School only wants you to study what you're passionate about (as long as that's a subset of programming) and not worry about whether that makes you more marketable. Hacker School also doesn't admit students based on their marketability or desire to get a job in the near future. Many Hacker Schoolers returned to college after the summer, and others took a leave of absence and are not seeking new employment but are returning to their old jobs. In my opinion, **this makes Hacker School a more pure academic experience** and thus a better one for everyone.


###What Hacker School is
The website describes Hacker School as a "writing retreat for programmers." This describes the actual set and setting of Hacker School pretty well. There are no teachers at Hacker School, only facilitators who are armed with a general idea of who is working on what to help you find someone to work with, their own interests and domains of knowledge (just like the other students), their own love of programming, and an immeasurable ability to keep you from getting lost on your journey when you need direction.

The residents that come for about a week at a time are often closer to teachers, but instead of giving lectures (although most gave a talk on the Monday they were there), they're the most skilled tutors that you'll ever be able to spend an hour pairing with or bouncing ideas off of.

**The biggest store of resources is the other students.** There's always someone who knows more than you on any given subject and because of the kinds of people that Hacker School admits and the [social rules](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules), everyone is friendly and eager to explain and wants to help you grow as a programmer. And sometimes, you'll be the person that knows more, helping someone less experienced while adding new rigor to your understanding. And if nobody knows more, there's at least someone else who's interested and you can plug away together at covering new ground. This happened to me about a third of the way through the batch while working with a Python API for a graph database that I was using. The maintainer of that API went on to add me on LinkedIn after I contacted him with a question at the behest of another Hacker Schooler. Cool!

What isn't immediately apparent about Hacker School, though, is that it doesn't end when the batch ends. Throughout the batch you'll go to informal events with the new friends you're making and you'll meet Hacker Schoolers from other batches and their friends. You'll add them on social media and for the Hacker Schoolers themselves you'll maintain access to the Hacker School [Zulip](http://zulip.com/hello/) for social and academic reasons going forward. This week I decided to start to move to emacs from vim and a number of my friends have been assisting me with this move via Zulip. And as the Hacker School alumni network grows, there will be more things to do in real life with other like-minded folks. If you stay in New York (which happens to a lot of people) there's already a lot to do, and the San Francisco branch of the network is growing as well, and starting in October there will be at least one Hacker Schooler in Austin, Texas.

###How Hacker School is Funded
####And how that affects its culture and you
Because Hacker School gets its funding through recruiting, if you **are** looking for a job, the founders will be there to help you prep for your interviews, coach you through interactions with the recruiters, get past the "resume stage" with any of the Hacker School partners (of which there are a surprisingly impressive and growing number) and get right into interviews, and when you get an offer they'll help you negotiate.

When I was looking for a job through Purdue's "Center for Career Opportunities" I received little assistance as far as being introduced to recruiters to begin with, no real networking opportunities, and no assistance regarding interacting with prospective employers before or during the hiring process. I did not receive an internship for this summer, and certainly it's not because I was unqualified. Purdue simply has no incentive to help me launch my career; they get paid either way.

Hacker School's career advice started on the second week. Dave told us "stop thinking about jobs." Saying you were learning a skill to become more marketable was taboo. If you started to say that, someone would tell you "no, you should do what you're interested in. You don't get to do Hacker School again. Don't spend it making yourself more marketable, spend it becoming a better programmer." Because Dave was right: becoming a better programmer **is** becoming more marketable and the best way to do both of those things is to focus on the things we love.

This emphasis on doing what I wanted to do led me to choose projects that I found engaging, difficult, and fun. It also led me further and further down in layers of abstraction, until I was writing `ping` and `traceroute` and in general doing things in C just for the fun of it. If I had been doing something to make myself more marketable in my own eyes, I would've instead spent a lot of time learning about SQL and JavaScript, two areas where I felt I was lacking and that some trendy startup would surely mark me off their hiring list for being deficient.

But the toys I wrote for fun in C and Python, outlined on my Hacker School profile, visible to Hacker School partner companies, attracted the attention of Juniper Networks, and starting in October I'll be gainfully employed. Hacker School will get paid based on a percentage of my first year salary because Juniper is a partner of Hacker School, and I'm going to have a full time job working on technology that I find far, far more exciting than the web.

So in short, the obvious way for this funding model to affect an organization like Hacker School is for it to be a coding bootcamp. But Nick, Dave, and Sonali understand that it's more important for Hacker School to be a place **and a network** full of self-motivated, curious, intelligent people doing what they love.

My great-grandfather Whitlock used to say "do what you love and the money will follow." I think that Hacker School believes in this and follows it wholeheartedly, and the whole Hacker School network has much to gain because they do.

So thank you Hacker School for giving me the most amazing summer of my life, helping me become a stronger, more confident, rigorous, and proficient programmer and computer scientist, and for helping me make a professional connection that will allow me to go forth and continue to do what I love.

Never graduate.
